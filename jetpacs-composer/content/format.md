# The Jetpacs CRUD app format, v4 — `app.org`

**STATUS: current format.** This document is the contract between the
composer (the desktop editor), `jetpacs-crud-orgapp.el` (the on-device
parser), and `jetpacs-crud.el` (the runtime). Anything not listed here
is not part of the format; adding a keyword, drawer property, column
type, or action requires a deliberate format change. A missing version
means the current version.

Version 4 is the **pack-reference surface**: `#+JETPACS_PACK:`
declarations and `pack:` sources/actions. Both parsers accept every
version up to 4 and reject anything above; the canonical writer stamps
**3 on documents that use no pack feature** (they keep opening on
pre-pack runtimes) and **4 exactly when a pack feature is present**.
New *vocabulary* inside the format — source schemes, column types,
action tokens, view kinds — is forward-lenient on both parsers and
never needs a version bump; only structural changes do.

An app is **one org file**. Everything the runtime needs is in it; the
data it manages lives in org tables — either inline in this file or in
external org files it references (the "backend").

## File-level keywords

Case-insensitive, like all org keywords.

| Keyword | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `#+JETPACS_APP: <id>` | yes | App id — a slug matching `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`. Its presence is what makes the file an app. |
| `#+TITLE:` | no | Launcher label (default: capitalized id). |
| `#+JETPACS_ICON:` | no | Material icon name for the launcher card (default `apps`). |
| `#+JETPACS_ORDER:` | no | Integer sort key for the launcher home (default 100). |
| `#+JETPACS_APP_FORMAT:` | no | Format version; valid values are up to `4`. The canonical writer always emits it: `3` for pack-free documents, `4` when any pack feature is used. |
| `#+JETPACS_INBOX:` | no | App-scoped quick-capture destination; relative paths resolve beside the app document. |
| `#+JETPACS_DEPENDS:` | no | Space-separated Emacs packages the device installs for this app (each a slug matching `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`), e.g. `vulpea org-ql`. Deployment metadata — see below. |
| `#+JETPACS_PACK:` | no | `<pack-id> [min-version]` — the manifest-backed engine pack this app's `pack:` references resolve against. See *DEPENDS vs PACK*. |
| `#+TODO:` | no | Org TODO keyword sequence used by TODO fields and actions. |
| `#+TAGS:` | no | File tag vocabulary offered by the composer. |

### `#+JETPACS_DEPENDS:` — engines the device installs

Some datasource kinds lean on Emacs packages that are not part of the
jetpacs core: **vulpea** (the note index behind the records/notes/board/
calendar/gallery/tree/dashboard/gantt kinds) and **org-ql** (rich
`:FILTER:` queries beyond the built-in subset). `#+JETPACS_DEPENDS:`
records which ones an app needs; the composer emits it automatically for
apps that use those kinds.

It is **deployment metadata, not a runtime requirement**. The composer's
device-setup snippet (see below) installs the named packages from MELPA,
and the runtime *records* the list but never acts on it — an app whose
device is missing a dependency still loads and simply degrades the
affected views (see per-kind notes). This keeps old bundles, and bundles
on a bare core, valid.

### DEPENDS vs PACK

Two different declarations, deliberately:

- `#+JETPACS_DEPENDS:` names **raw Emacs package slugs** the device
  installs (vulpea, org-ql). No contract beyond "install this".
- `#+JETPACS_PACK: <pack-id> [min-version]` names a **manifest-backed
  engine pack** — one whose author publishes a `<pack-id>-pack.json`
  contract (generated from `jetpacs-source-catalog` +
  `jetpacs-action-catalog`; Glasspane's `glasspane-pack.json` is the
  reference). The declaration is what the document's
  `pack:<pack-id>/<name>` sources and actions resolve against: the
  composer drives its pickers and validation from the installed
  manifest, the deployer installs the manifest's `depends`, and the
  runtime requires the pack's feature before binding (fail-closed —
  a device without the pack renders those views unavailable and
  dispatches nothing).

The composer declares the pack automatically when a view references
one. Like `DEPENDS`, the declaration itself never blocks an app from
loading anywhere.

### Pack binding at runtime (fail closed)

The bundle a pack-backed app exports embeds one
`jetpacs-crud-pack-register` form derived from the **locally installed
manifest the export ran against** (export refuses to run without it).
That registration — pack id, feature, version, declared source/action
names — is *trusted generated code*; the document alone can never
register a pack, choose a feature, or trigger an install (SPEC §5).

Rendering a `pack:` view resolves, in order: the pack is registered and
uncontested (two manifests claiming one id with *different features*
serve nothing; a newer version of the same pack simply supersedes an
older one), the installed version satisfies the document's
`#+JETPACS_PACK:` minimum, the pack's feature `require`s (a feature that
errors mid-load degrades to the placeholder, never crashes the view),
the source name is declared by the manifest AND present in the core
source registry. Any failure renders the unavailable-view placeholder
naming the reason, with no mutation affordances. Source params bind from
the view's `:FILTER:` string: if every whitespace token is `key=value`
with declared param keys, each binds by name; otherwise the raw string
binds the source's `query` param when it declares one. A required param
the view cannot bind fails the query — and the view degrades — rather
than guessing.

A `pack:` view renders its rows as **read-only cards** (title, schema
fields, and the view's declared pack-action buttons), regardless of its
`:KIND:` — a `pack:`-sourced `board`/`calendar` does not yet get lanes or
a month grid the way a file/vault-backed one does. Mutation is through
the view's declared pack actions only, never the `crud.*` file handlers.

Pack actions dispatch through the closed `crud.pack.action` handler:
the token must be declared by the **registered** view's `:ACTIONS:`
(the wire cannot invent one), the pack must resolve as above, and the
action name must be in the manifest's declared list AND registered in
the device's action registry. Static args come from the **registered
document's** declared token options (`(key=value,…)`) — a tap fires a
declared action but can never supply or rewrite its options; dynamic
args (like the tapped record's `ref`) ride the wire and never override a
static one. Anything short of all of it is a clean error with nothing
dispatched.

### Device setup — what installs the engines

The composer provisions a device once, either by pasting its **install
snippet** into `~/.emacs.d/init.el` (after `(require 'jetpacs-core)`) or
by running **Setup device** against a live Termux Emacs. Both run the
same forms over the app's **install list** — the selected pack
manifest's `depends` for a pack-backed app, else the document's own
`#+JETPACS_DEPENDS:` plus what its views require (`org-ql`/`vulpea`) —
installing each from MELPA (retried each launch until they succeed; an
offline launch never breaks startup; built-ins like `org` and `cl-lib`
are no-ops via `package-installed-p`), then enabling
`vulpea-db-autosync-mode` over the org vault and the installed-apps
directory so the index tracks the vault — including external edits from
git or Syncthing. A first-run marker triggers one full scan so an
existing vault is indexed before the first query.

A dependency naming a **Termux binary** (rg/ripgrep, fd, git, sqlite3)
is never handed to `package-install`: the deploy dialog surfaces it as
an "install via Termux (`pkg install …`)" warning instead.

## Views

**Every top-level (level-1) heading is a view.** By default each is its
own bottom-bar tab, with the heading title as the label; `:NAV:` and
`:GROUP:` (see *Navigation placement*) move it elsewhere. Configuration
lives in the heading's property drawer:

| Property | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `:ICON:` | Tab icon (Material name; default `table_chart` for tables, `checklist` for checklists). |
| `:ORDER:` | Tab order (integer; default: 10, 20, … in document order). |
| `:KIND:` | `table` (default), `checklist`, `records`, `notes`, `board`, `calendar`, `gallery`, `tree`, `dashboard`, or `gantt`. |
| `:SOURCE:` | Where the data lives — see below. Default `inline`. |
| `:COLTYPES:` | Table and records views: per-column/field types, space-separated, positional. |
| `:COLUMNS:` | Table views with an external `:SOURCE:`: column names, `|`-separated, used to scaffold the backend table when its file doesn't exist yet. |
| `:SCHEMA:` | Records and notes views (required): the fields, as org column-view-style tokens — `%PROP` or `%PROP(Label)`. |
| `:FILTER:` | Records and notes views: a query selecting which records show — an org-ql sexp, filter tokens, or free text (see below). |
| `:GROUP_BY:` | Board views: schema field used for lanes (default `TODO`). |
| `:DATE_FIELD:` | Calendar views: schema field containing the org timestamp/date (default `DEADLINE`). |
| `:IMAGE_FIELD:` | Gallery views: schema field containing the image URL/path (default `IMAGE`). |
| `:METRICS:` | Dashboard views: `|`-separated `count`, `sum(FIELD)`, or `avg(FIELD)` chart blocks. |
| `:ACTIONS:` | Records-like views: closed, space-separated org action tokens (see below). |
| `:ON:` | Optional closed automation type; currently only `date-field`. |
| `:REL:` | With `:ON: date-field`, a whole-day offset such as `-3d`, `0d`, or `+1d`. |
| `:DATEFIELD:` | With `:ON: date-field`, the schema property supplying the org date/timestamp. |
| `:NAV:` | `tab` (default) or `drawer` — where the view lives in the chrome (see below). |
| `:GROUP:` | A destination name; views sharing one collapse into a single tabbed bottom destination (see below). |

### Engines and degradation — what each kind needs on the device

Every data-bearing kind reads through the **vulpea** index (the
composer's [device setup](#device-setup--what-installs-the-engines)
installs it; declare it with `#+JETPACS_DEPENDS:`). The app bundle
itself never *depends* on the engines — it always loads and its
chrome/navigation always works on bare `jetpacs-core`; only the view
bodies degrade:

| Kind | Engine used | On a device without it |
|---|---|---|
| `table`, `checklist` | vulpea (the plugin extractor indexes tables and checkboxes) | a "needs vulpea" placeholder |
| `records`, `board`, `calendar`, `gallery`, `tree`, `dashboard`, `gantt` | vulpea (records come from the note index) | a "needs vulpea" placeholder |
| `notes` | vulpea (the vault **is** the datasource) | a "Notes need vulpea" placeholder |
| a `:FILTER:` beyond the built-in subset | org-ql | a clear error naming org-ql — never a silently empty view |

Installing an engine mid-session counts: pull to refresh and the views
light up (the availability probes re-check on refresh).

### Navigation placement — `:NAV:` and `:GROUP:`

A Material bottom bar holds only about five destinations comfortably, so
a many-view app spreads across the chrome:

- **`:NAV: drawer`** routes a view into the navigation drawer (the ☰
  hamburger) instead of the bottom bar. The view is still shipped and
  switching to it is instant (no round-trip) — it just isn't a tab. Use
  it for secondary or reference views. `:NAV: tab` (the default) keeps
  the view on the bottom bar.
- **`:GROUP: Name`** folds a view, together with every other view that
  names the same group, into **one** bottom destination whose body is a
  top tab row (swipe or tap between the members). The destination's
  label is the group `Name`; its icon and bar position come from the
  first member (lowest `:ORDER:`). This is the "one dataset seen several
  ways" pattern — e.g. a task list, board, and calendar under `Tasks`.

`:GROUP:` wins over `:NAV:` (a grouped view is part of its destination,
not a standalone drawer entry). The group shares a single add button —
the first member's — so tapping **+** from any of its tabs adds through
that member's view. `:GROUP:` is a placement name and is unrelated to
records' `:GROUP_BY:`, which lanes a single board's records.

### `:SOURCE:`

- `inline` (default) — the data is the first org table (or, for
  checklists, the first checkbox list) in this view's own subtree.
  The app file is then also a data file.
- `/absolute/path/file.org` — the first table/list in that file.
- `/absolute/path/file.org::*Heading title` — the first table/list
  under that heading.
- `/absolute/path/vault/` (trailing slash) — **notes** views only: a
  vulpea vault directory, where every `.org` note file is one record
  (see Notes views).
- `pack:<pack-id>/<source>` — an external pack datasource, bound to a
  `jetpacs-defsource` registry entry. Both halves must be non-empty
  (`pack:` with no `/<source>` is a malformed document); whether the
  named pack actually exists is a *runtime* question — a device without
  it renders the view as unavailable and dispatches nothing, it never
  rejects the app.
- Any other `scheme:` prefix is **future source vocabulary**: parsers
  accept it, preserve the value verbatim on round-trip, and render the
  view as unavailable. (`::` continuations don't count — `file.org::*H`
  stays a file source.) New source types therefore never need a format
  version bump.

If an external source does not exist at registration time, the runtime
creates it when it can — and **the view's own body in the app document
is its seed**. For an external-source view that body is otherwise dead
space, so it is defined as the authored initial content of the
scaffolded source (how a sample app arrives pre-loaded):

- **File sources**: the body (prose, table, list items, record
  sub-headings — everything below the property drawer) is written into
  the newly created file, heading levels shifted so records land at the
  file's top level (or one under the `::*Heading`). With no body, the
  old templates apply: table views need `:COLUMNS:` for the header row;
  checklist and records views get the bare file/heading.
- **Vault directory sources** (notes views): each record heading in the
  body becomes one `.org` note file — file-level `:ID:` (what vulpea
  indexes by), the record's drawer properties, `#+TITLE:`, and its
  body. Prose outside record headings is documentation and stays in the
  app document only.

Seeding is create-once: an existing file or directory is never touched,
so re-deploys and restarts cannot resurrect deleted data. A table view
without `:COLUMNS:` and without a body whose source is missing renders
an empty-state, never an error.

### `:COLTYPES:` — the column types

Positional, one token per table column:

| Token | Meaning | Edit affordance | Rendering |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text` | free text (the default for unlisted columns) | native text dialog | as-is |
| `number` | numeric | text dialog, numeric-validated | right-aligned |
| `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | text dialog, format-validated | as-is |
| `enum(A,B,C)` | one of the listed options | native single-choice dialog | as-is |
| `checkbox` | `[X]` / `[ ]` | tap toggles directly | checkbox icon |

Unknown future column-type tokens load as opaque text fields and are preserved
verbatim. `ref(View)` stores the target record's stable org `:ID:`; the optional
`ref(View,FIELD)` form renders `FIELD` instead of the target's `ITEM`. `View`
must name a records or notes view in the same app, and records targets must
include `ID` in their schema. Editing presents the target records as choices,
while tapping drills in by `(app, view, id)`, never by sending a source path
over the wire.

Table views additionally offer paste-driven CSV import. The first row must
exactly match the current table header. Every subsequent row must have the same
width and pass its declared column type (`number`, `date`, `checkbox`, or
`enum`) before any source mutation begins; the first error reports its CSV row,
column, and label. A valid batch appends atomically through the normal org-table
mutation path. CSV import does not synthesize records or notes.

### Date-field reminders

A record-like view may derive durable reminders from org dates:

```org
:ON: date-field
:REL: -3d
:DATEFIELD: DEADLINE
```

The rule reads the declared schema field through core org, adds the whole-day
offset, and identifies each reminder by app, view, stable record ID, field, and
offset. Records therefore need an `ID` schema field; notes use their native ID.
Transient search text does not suppress alarms. Reminder publication requires
Jetpacs' owner-merged reminder seam: Composer will warn and arm nothing on an
older framework rather than overwrite another app's device-global reminder set.

### Quick capture

`#+JETPACS_INBOX: inbox.org` enables an app-scoped quick-capture action. The
runtime resolves this path from the registered document (relative paths are
relative to that document), prompts only for a title, and appends one top-level
heading with native `ID` and `CREATED` properties. The wire carries only the app
ID: it cannot choose a path, edit an existing entry, or delete one. Composer
exposes capture in the app top bar and registers the per-app default FAB for
app-owned views that do not already use a FAB.

## Table views (`:KIND: table`)

The first row of the table is the header (= the schema's column names);
a rule after it is conventional but not required. Rendering and
interaction:

- Tap a cell → edit it (typed by `:COLTYPES:`).
- Tap a checkbox-column cell → toggle it.
- Long-press a cell → row menu: *Insert row above · Delete row · Edit cell*.
- The `+` strip under the table, and the view's FAB → append a row
  (a typed prompt per column, in order).
- A `#+TBLFM:` line after the table is respected: mutations trigger
  recalculation Emacs-side. (Editing formulas from the phone is out of
  scope for v2 — a formula-computed cell is simply overwritten on next
  recalc if hand-edited.)

## Checklist views (`:KIND: checklist`)

The source is a checkbox plain list. Tap the checkbox icon → toggle.
The FAB appends a new unchecked item (one text prompt).

## Records views (`:KIND: records`) — org's native record shape

A record is a heading with a property drawer: the shape existing org
files already have. The records of a view are the **direct children**
of the `:SOURCE:` heading (or the level-1 headings of the file when no
heading is given); anything outside those subtrees is never touched.

`:SCHEMA:` declares the fields as org column-view-style tokens,
optionally typed positionally by `:COLTYPES:`:

```org
* People
:PROPERTIES:
:KIND: records
:SOURCE: /sdcard/org/contacts.org::*Contacts
:SCHEMA: %ITEM(Name) %TODO(Status) %Phone %Tier %DEADLINE(Renewal)
:COLTYPES: text text text text date
:FILTER: (property "Tier" "Gold")
:END:
```

Core org does the heavy lifting — this is deliberate:

- **Special properties are first-class fields.** `ITEM` (the heading
  text), `TODO`, `DEADLINE`, `SCHEDULED`, `PRIORITY` read and write
  through org's own machinery (`org-entry-get`/`org-entry-put`), so a
  `TODO` field cycles the file's *real* keyword sequence (`#+TODO:`
  lines respected), and `DEADLINE` writes a real planning line.
- **Enums come from the file.** org's allowed-values convention — a
  `Tier_ALL` property (drawer or `#+PROPERTY:` line) — supplies the
  choice list for `Tier`; when present it wins over `:COLTYPES:`.
  `TODO` gets its choices from the keyword sequence the same way.
- **Filtering speaks org-ql's query language** (`:FILTER:`) — see below.

### `:FILTER:` — selecting records

The filter is parsed into an [org-ql](https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql)
sexp. Three ways to write one, from most to least explicit:

| Shape | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| org-ql sexp | `(and (todo "NEXT") (tags "work"))` | full boolean query |
| filter tokens | `todo:NEXT tags:work,home priority:A` | tokens AND together; commas are any-of |
| free text | `renewal gold` | each word is a substring match on heading + body |

An empty `:FILTER:` shows every record; a malformed query is an error,
so an empty result always means "nothing matched", never "didn't parse".

**One subset, every heading kind.** Records, notes, and every derived
kind filter identically: the query is evaluated off the **vulpea index**
(no file visit) by the canonical matcher in the jetpacs core
(`jetpacs-org-note-matches-p`, api 1.6.0). Table views are unfiltered —
see non-goals.

| FILTER terms | Evaluated by |
|---|---|
| `and` `or` `not` · `todo` `done` · `tags` · `priority` · `heading` · `regexp` · `property` · `level` · `scheduled` `deadline` | the index — nothing needed beyond vulpea |
| anything else (org-ql's full query language) | handed to **org-ql** wholesale over the source file |

Index-subset semantics worth knowing:

- `regexp` matches the heading title + properties — the index does not
  carry entry bodies. A body-text filter is an org-ql term.
- `todo` / `done` judge done-ness against the **global**
  `org-done-keywords` (falling back to `DONE`) plus a `CLOSED` stamp.
  A file-local `#+TODO:` line with exotic done keywords isn't visible
  to the index — write such a filter as an org-ql term instead.
- Without org-ql installed, an out-of-subset term is a clear error
  naming the package, not a silent empty view. The org-ql arm visits
  headings, so it applies to heading-per-record sources; file-per-record
  notes (level-0 note files) have no heading for it to visit — narrow
  the `:SOURCE:` instead.

Rendering: one card per record — title line (`ITEM`, prefixed by the
`TODO` keyword when in the schema), then one tappable row per remaining
field. Tap a field → typed edit; the card menu deletes the record
(with confirmation); the FAB adds one (typed prompt per schema field,
appended at the end of the source subtree).

A missing external source is scaffolded (file + heading); records
themselves come from the FAB or from your own editing.

### Record actions — `:ACTIONS:`

Actions are a closed, space-separated vocabulary attached to each record card:

- `todo(KEYWORD)` · `schedule` · `deadline`
- `tags` or `tags(a,b)` · `priority` or `priority(A)`
- `refile` or `refile(TARGET)` · `archive` or `archive(STYLE)`
- `pack:<pack-id>/<action>` or `pack:<pack-id>/<action>(args)` — both
  halves non-empty (`pack:` with no `/<action>` is malformed and rejects
  the document); a device without the named pack shows the button but
  dispatches nothing.

They dispatch through the single closed `crud.action.apply` handler (pack
tokens through `crud.pack.action`) and map to org's own mutation commands.
Unknown future tokens are preserved and ignored by an older runtime rather
than preventing the whole app from loading.

Table and record-like views also expose explicit top-bar export actions: copy
CSV, copy org-table text, and share CSV. CSV cells beginning with optional
whitespace followed by `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` are prefixed with an apostrophe to
prevent spreadsheet formula execution. Share recomputes the data from the
registered view and never accepts a source or destination path from the wire.

## Derived record views

`board`, `calendar`, `gallery`, and `tree` use the same `:SCHEMA:`, `:SOURCE:`,
`:FILTER:`, card actions, and mutation boundary as records:

- **board** groups cards into ordered lanes using `:GROUP_BY:` and the field's
  allowed values.
- **calendar** marks dates from `:DATE_FIELD:` in the native month grid, with a
  grouped-card fallback when that node is unavailable.
- **gallery** reads an image URL/path from `:IMAGE_FIELD:` and otherwise renders
  the normal record card.
- **tree** walks the source outline at every depth and supports org-native
  reorder/reparent operations.

Tapping a record card—or a resolved reference value—opens a full-height detail
sheet. It uses the appropriate records/notes identity resolver, shows every
schema field with its typed/reference behavior, retains configured actions, and
adds the org entry's body prose below the fields. Writes still use the original
view-bound mutation handlers; the detail overlay does not accept a source path.

## Dashboard views (`:KIND: dashboard`)

Dashboards reuse the records source, schema, and filter contract. `:METRICS:`
declares one or more closed aggregations, for example `count | sum(Amount) |
avg(Amount)`. Optional `:GROUP_BY:` supplies the chart's labeled x-axis; without
it every metric has one `All` point. Each metric renders as a bar-chart card.
Blank/non-numeric cells do not contribute to sum or average. When the companion
does not advertise the additive `chart` node, the dashboard degrades to the
normal records list over the same filtered data.

## Gantt views (`:KIND: gantt`)

Gantt views are record views with a fixed org-native timeline contract:
`SCHEDULED` is the start, `DEADLINE` is the end, and `TODO` is progress/state.
All three properties must appear in `:SCHEMA:`. Until the companion advertises
a native timeline node, records render as fully actionable cards sorted by end
date (then start date), with a visible `start → end · TODO` footer; undated
records sort last. This fallback preserves filters, details, references, and
configured actions.

## Notes views (`:KIND: notes`) — a vulpea vault as the datasource

A notes view is a records view whose datasource is a
[vulpea](https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea) note database. It is the
one datasource that needs a package on the device: **vulpea (v2+)**.
Without it the view renders a "Notes need vulpea" placeholder and the
rest of the app runs normally — the bundle never depends on vulpea, it
uses it when present.

`:SCHEMA:` works exactly as for records, and `:FILTER:` speaks the same
one subset every heading kind does (see
[`:FILTER:`](#filter--selecting-records)) — with the caveat that the
org-ql extension only reaches heading-per-record sources. Fields are org
**properties** on each note, which vulpea indexes. The `:SOURCE:` picks
one of two record shapes:

- `contacts/` (a trailing-slash directory) — **file-per-record**: every
  `.org` note file in the vault is one record. Adding a record writes a
  new note file (`<slug>.org`, with an `:ID:`); deleting one deletes the
  file.
- `people.org::*Team` — **heading-per-record**: the id'd headings
  directly under that heading are the records, same as a records view
  but addressed by their stable note `:ID:` rather than file position.

```org
* People
:PROPERTIES:
:KIND: notes
:SOURCE: /sdcard/org/contacts/
:SCHEMA: %ITEM(Name) %Phone %Tier
:COLTYPES: text text enum(Gold,Silver,Bronze)
:FILTER: (property "Tier" "Gold")
:END:
```

Why vulpea rather than a raw file scan: its SQLite index supplies the
list without opening every file, and a record keeps a stable `:ID:`
across external edits (Syncthing, git) — so a tapped card still resolves
to the right note after the vault has been re-sorted underneath it. The
runtime only ever *reads* from vulpea and asks it to re-index a file it
just wrote; the writes themselves go through org and `org-id`. The
composer's device setup installs vulpea and enables
`vulpea-db-autosync-mode` (see [Device setup](#device-setup--what-installs-the-engines)),
so the index tracks the vault; declare the dependency with
`#+JETPACS_DEPENDS: vulpea`.

The wire adds `crud.note.add`, `crud.note.field.edit`, and
`crud.note.menu` for these views; the record's `:ID:` travels on the
wire, but a handler still refuses any note whose file falls outside the
view's declared `:SOURCE:`.

## What the runtime does to your files (read before pointing at one)

Bringing your own org file is the point of records views — and the
cost of the abstraction is that **the runtime must own the layout of
the records it manages**. Mutations go through org-mode's own
commands, which normalize what they touch:

- **Adopting IDs on install.** The heading-family kinds (records,
  board, calendar, gallery, tree, dashboard, gantt, and notes) read
  their records from the **vulpea index**, which only sees headings
  that carry an org `:ID:`. So when such a view is registered the
  runtime silently gives its source file a file-level `:ID:`, an `:ID:`
  on the source heading, and one on each record heading, then asks
  vulpea to re-index. This is idempotent (a file that already has the
  ids is untouched and not re-saved), touches only the view's own
  declared source, and no-ops entirely when vulpea is absent. IDs are
  the same infrastructure org-roam/vulpea workflows already rely on.
- Editing a field creates or reindents the record's property drawer
  and rewrites the affected property/planning line.
- Deleting a record deletes its **entire subtree** — body text
  included. The confirmation dialog is the only guard.
- Adding a record appends a normalized heading (with an `:ID:`) at the
  end of the source subtree.

Every record write is followed by a vulpea re-index of the file, so the
view refreshes against the current contents. This applies to **every
datasource kind**, including `table` and `checklist`: those have no
`:ID:` to hang on, so a vulpea *plugin extractor* indexes their org
tables and checkbox items from the id-adopted source file instead. A
device **without vulpea** renders every kind as a "needs vulpea"
placeholder rather than reading it — install the dependency
(`#+JETPACS_DEPENDS: vulpea`, see
[Device setup](#device-setup--what-installs-the-engines)).

Text *outside* managed records (prose, other headings, the source
heading's own body) is never touched, and record body text survives
field edits — but hand-crafted formatting *inside* a managed drawer or
planning line will not. **Keep BYO files under version control or
backups.** This is the same deal desktop org-mode users already accept
from `org-entry-put`, made explicit.

### Redeploying an app (update in place)

An app's document lives on the device under the apps directory; the
first install writes it verbatim. A **later install of the same id
updates in place** instead of clobbering — it adopts the redeployed
document's *structure* while keeping the device's *data*:

- Adopted from the new document: the file keywords, the set of views and
  their order, view prose, and every view's **property drawer** (`:KIND:`,
  `:ICON:`, `:SCHEMA:`, `:NAV:`, `:GROUP:`, …). So a layout or config
  change reaches the device on the next deploy.
- Kept from the device: each still-present view's **body** — the inline
  table rows, checklist items, and records the user has edited. Views are
  matched **by heading title**; a view the new document drops is removed
  (its data with it), a new view arrives with its template body, and
  *renaming* a view in the composer resets that view's data (it reads as
  drop-plus-add).
- If the merged result cannot be parsed back — a corrupt on-device file —
  the existing document is kept untouched rather than risk its data, and a
  warning is logged.

So iterating on structure is safe: redeploy and the new drawers/views
appear without wiping inline data. The one thing not carried across a
redeploy is on-device edits to a view's *prose* — that follows the body,
so composer prose changes don't overwrite it once the view has data.

## Actions (the closed vocabulary)

The wire names these and only these; all are implemented in
`jetpacs-crud.el` against org-mode primitives, and every handler
validates that the `file` argument is one of the registered app's
declared sources before touching anything.

`crud.cell.edit` · `crud.cell.toggle` · `crud.row.add` ·
`crud.row.menu` · `crud.checkbox.toggle` · `crud.item.add` ·
`crud.field.edit` · `crud.field.state-sink` · `crud.record.add` ·
`crud.record.add.submit` · `crud.record.detail` · `crud.record.menu` ·
`crud.record.duplicate` · `crud.note.add` · `crud.note.field.edit` ·
`crud.note.menu` · `crud.view.search` · `crud.action.apply` ·
`crud.node.move` · `crud.dialog.dismiss`

Every mutation ends in: save file → repush all views (positions are
recomputed from a fresh parse on every render, so they can never go
stale).

## Explicit v2 non-goals

No conditionals, no formula editing, no arbitrary layout, no per-node
styling, no cross-source references, no tag editing, no filters on
table views. These are deliberate; see the plan's Deferred section
before proposing one.

> Format note: v2 is a clean pre-release cutover. There is no installed v1
> base and therefore no v1 migration or fallback path. All canonical fixtures,
> templates, generated documents, and runtime parsers move together.

## Examples (the canonical fixtures)

Two documents pin the format, smallest first:

- [`elisp/test/fixtures/pantry.org`](https://github.com/calebc42/jetpacs-composer/blob/slop-fork/main/elisp/test/fixtures/pantry.org) —
  the minimal app: an Inventory table view (inline source, five typed
  columns) plus a Shopping checklist view, in ~25 lines.
- [`elisp/test/fixtures/hello-world.org`](https://github.com/calebc42/jetpacs-composer/blob/slop-fork/main/elisp/test/fixtures/hello-world.org) —
  the kitchen sink: every view kind, every column type, all eight
  schema specials, a filter, the full action vocabulary, a scaffolded
  external source, and a notes vault.  Three consumers keep it honest
  (ERT parse+register+lint, the bare-core bundle smoke, and OrgCodec
  parse/validate/round-trip as the gallery's demo template), and
  kind-coverage tests on both sides fail whenever a new view kind
  lands without growing it.  The prebuilt bundle ships at the repo
  root as `jetpacs-app-hello-world.el` — push it to a device and load
  it to exercise everything at once.
