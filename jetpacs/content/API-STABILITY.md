# API stability — what a Tier 1 can depend on

This document is the contract between the core (`jetpacs-core.el`) and a
third-party Tier 1. Everything listed here is **public and stable**:
within a major version of `jetpacs-api-version` it will not be removed or
change signature incompatibly. Everything else is internal.

- **`jetpacs-api-version`** (a defconst in `jetpacs.el`) is the semver of this
  surface. Check it: `(version<= "1.0.0" jetpacs-api-version)`.
- **The wire/vocabulary version is `jetpacs-protocol-version`** (the SPEC
  number, the envelope `v`) — a *separate* number. Node-vocabulary
  additions are negotiated per-connection (see `jetpacs-node-supported-p`),
  not gated on this.

> **Note on `1.3.0`.** That version exposes *two* independently landed
> additive batches under one number — owner-scoped reminders and the
> foundation-root invariants — so `(version<= "1.3.0" …)` cannot tell them
> apart. Policy going forward: **one minor bump per independently landed API
> batch** (not per individual addition). `1.4.0` opens the binding-layer track
> (the machine-readable wire contract in `ebp/contract.json`, and the promoted
> shell/files/action seams below); `1.5.0` is the binding layer itself;
> `1.6.0` is the org note-index batch (the `vulpea-note` accessor of the one
> query grammar, plus the guarded vulpea source query); `1.7.0` is the
> platform-hardening Phase H batch (the build-feature probe pair and the
> read-only `:render` settings row below — byte-compile-at-adopt and the
> package-vc headers add behavior, not symbols); `1.8.0` is the hypertext
> substrate (the document renderer under eww/help/Info, its shr rider seam,
> and the promoted follow-shim below); `1.9.0` is the magit-section
> substrate (section buffers as collapsible cards below); `1.10.0` is the
> remote-hosts hub (the server pillar's front door below); `1.11.0` is the
> Spec 1.0-rc schema registry (`jetpacs-lint-payload` and the authored
> node/kind schema tables under Validation below); `1.12.0` is
> configurable notification action buttons (`jetpacs-notification-action`
> and the `:actions` argument to `jetpacs-notification-spec`, SPEC §9);
> `1.18.0` is the conditions core (the `:when` state gate on
> `jetpacs-trigger-register`, `jetpacs-device-state`, and
> `jetpacs-lint-trigger` with its predicate-type vocabulary under
> Validation below — SPEC §10–§11); `1.19.0` is the DSL-ergonomics
> authoring batch (the semantic-text shorthands and the `jetpacs-try`
> sub-tree error boundary below — pure composites/macros over existing
> nodes, no wire change; docs/PLAN-dsl-ergonomics.md A1/A2); `1.20.0` is
> the declarative async loader (`jetpacs-async` and its
> `jetpacs-async-clear-owner`/`jetpacs-async-reset` teardown below — a
> keyed loader state machine that re-pushes on completion, still no wire
> change; docs/PLAN-dsl-ergonomics.md B1); `1.21.0` is the devtools
> instrumentation batch (the live report, last-spec accessor, and reset
> below — pure observation of existing seams, no wire change;
> docs/AUDIT-architecture-vui-vulpea.md item 1.4); `1.22.0` is the
> explicit `:key` lazy-list identity on `jetpacs-row`/`jetpacs-card`/
> `jetpacs-list-item` (an additive wire attr — SPEC §9, ebp
> SPEC-CHANGES #12; companions that predate it key by id/position);
> `1.23.0` is the grocy-hardening gap closure
> (docs/PLAN-grocy-hardening.md #11–#13 + the fixture gap): `:confirm`
> on `jetpacs-action` (an Emacs-side dispatch gate — the string rides
> the descriptor, companion-opaque), `jetpacs-additive` (the badge's
> self-describing degrade, generalized), `jetpacs-action-with-arg`
> (promoted from `--`), and `jetpacs-test-reset-state` (the public
> test-fixture seam replacing let-bound internals); `1.24.0` is the
> adversarial-review follow-up batch: `:key` on `jetpacs-column`/
> `jetpacs-box`/`jetpacs-surface` (completing the lazy_column-child
> container coverage — same additive attr as 1.22.0), the full
> `jetpacs-test-reset-state` scope (async/source/devtools stores, shell
> tab and snackbar, the action timestamp), a lint warning for `key` on a
> non-`lazy_column` parent's child, and `jetpacs-additive` signalling on
> a `tabs` node instead of silently discarding its pages; `1.25.0` is
> the command-visibility vocabulary (`jetpacs-command-visible-p`,
> `jetpacs-suppressed-commands`, and the `jetpacs-unsupported` symbol
> property under Command visibility below — the device M-x picker's
> completion predicate; pure elisp, no wire change).

## The two rules

1. **`--` means internal.** Any symbol with a double dash after the
   package prefix (`jetpacs--node`, `jetpacs-shell--schedule-repush`,
   `jetpacs-lint--walk`) is private: no stability promise, may change or
   vanish in any release. Do not call it from a Tier 1. If you find
   yourself needing one, that is a bug report ("promote X to public"), not
   a dependency.
2. **Deprecation is gradual.** A public symbol is never removed abruptly:
   it is first marked with `make-obsolete` (which warns at byte-compile),
   survives at least one minor release, and is only removed on a major
   bump. A Tier 1 that compiles cleanly on version N keeps working through
   all of N.x.

## The public surface

### Widget constructors (`jetpacs-widgets.el`)

The node vocabulary. Wire shapes are pinned by `ebp/goldens/widgets.golden`;
the authoring reference is [WIDGETS.md](WIDGETS.md).

Content: `jetpacs-text` `jetpacs-markup` `jetpacs-rich-text` `jetpacs-span`
`jetpacs-icon` `jetpacs-image` `jetpacs-date-stamp` `jetpacs-divider`
`jetpacs-section-header` `jetpacs-empty-state` `jetpacs-progress`
`jetpacs-month-abbrev` (since 1.4.0: the 1–12 → abbrev helper behind
`jetpacs-date-stamp`).

Layout: `jetpacs-row` `jetpacs-flow-row` `jetpacs-scroll-row` `jetpacs-column`
`jetpacs-scroll-column` `jetpacs-box` `jetpacs-surface` `jetpacs-card` `jetpacs-list-item`
`jetpacs-border`
`jetpacs-lazy-column` `jetpacs-scroll-here` `jetpacs-spacer` `jetpacs-collapsible`
`jetpacs-reorderable-list` `jetpacs-table` `jetpacs-table-row` `jetpacs-table-rule`
`jetpacs-table-cell` `jetpacs-swipe-action` `jetpacs-tabs` `jetpacs-tab-item`.
(`row`/`column`/`flow-row` take trailing `:spacing`/`:align`/`:scroll`
keywords; `box`/`surface`/`card` take
`:width`/`:height`/`:fill-fraction`/`:border`; `card` takes
`:swipe-start`/`:swipe-end`. Since 1.22.0, `row`/`card`/`list-item`
take `:key` — a stable string identity for the node as a `lazy_column`
child, so structural pushes preserve its client-side state, scroll
anchor, and animation; `column`/`box`/`surface` take it since 1.24.0
(and lint warns when a `key` sits on a non-`lazy_column` parent's
child, where the companion never reads it). Since 1.13.0, additively: `box`/`surface`/
`card` accept their children as a single list *or* `&rest` nodes (like
`row`/`column`), and `jetpacs-text`'s options are positional *or*
keyword.)

Input: `jetpacs-button` `jetpacs-icon-button` `jetpacs-chip` `jetpacs-assist-chip` `jetpacs-badge`
`jetpacs-menu` `jetpacs-menu-item` `jetpacs-checkbox` `jetpacs-switch` `jetpacs-slider`
`jetpacs-text-input` `jetpacs-enum-list` `jetpacs-date-button` `jetpacs-time-button`
`jetpacs-editor` `jetpacs-toolbar-item`.

Visualization: `jetpacs-chart` `jetpacs-chart-series` `jetpacs-canvas`
`jetpacs-draw-line` `jetpacs-draw-rect` `jetpacs-draw-circle` `jetpacs-draw-path`
`jetpacs-draw-text` `jetpacs-month-grid`.

Composites (since 1.13.0 — pure-elisp shapes over the primitives above,
no new wire type): `jetpacs-stepper` `jetpacs-segmented` `jetpacs-stat`
`jetpacs-kv` `jetpacs-sectioned-list`. Since 1.19.0, semantic-text
shorthands (intent-named wrappers over `jetpacs-text`/`jetpacs-rich-text`):
`jetpacs-heading` `jetpacs-muted` `jetpacs-error` `jetpacs-warning`
`jetpacs-success` `jetpacs-strong` `jetpacs-code` — and `jetpacs-try`, a
macro wrapping a node-producing form so a builder throw becomes a local
fallback node instead of blanking the view. (`jetpacs-warning`/
`jetpacs-success` emit the `warning`/`success` color tokens; a companion
predating them in `resolveColor` falls through to the ambient text color,
so the text still renders untinted.)

Chrome: `jetpacs-scaffold` `jetpacs-top-bar` `jetpacs-bottom-bar` `jetpacs-nav-item`
`jetpacs-drawer` `jetpacs-drawer-item` `jetpacs-fab` `jetpacs-snackbar-action`.
(`nav-item`/`drawer-item`/`icon`/`icon-button` take `:badge`;
`text-input` takes `:keyboard`; `jetpacs-send-dialog` takes an optional
STYLE / `jetpacs-dialog-style`. Since 1.25.0, `text-input` takes
`:autofocus` and `:clear-on-submit`, and `jetpacs-editor` takes
`:autofocus` and `:on-enter` — the fluid-editing batch, SPEC amendment
#14.)

Actions: `jetpacs-action` `jetpacs-clipboard-action`; since 1.23.0,
`jetpacs-action-with-arg` (bake a typed value into a template action's
args) and the `:confirm` keyword on `jetpacs-action` (a dispatch-time
native yes/no gate; declining is a no-op), plus `jetpacs-additive` (wrap
an additive node with a self-describing fallback child, the badge
degrade pattern generalized).

Home-surface composition: `jetpacs-widget-item` `jetpacs-widget-divider`
`jetpacs-tile`.

Notification surfaces: `jetpacs-notification-spec` (`meta` + a content
body) and `jetpacs-notification-action` (since 1.12.0: a `meta.actions`
button — `label`, an `on_tap` action, and optional `:icon` / `:dismiss` /
`:reply` inline text reply; the `:actions` argument of
`jetpacs-notification-spec` takes a list of them, SPEC §9).

### Session & negotiation (`jetpacs.el`)

`jetpacs-connected-p` `jetpacs-granted-p` `jetpacs-node-supported-p`
`jetpacs-device-caps` `jetpacs-device-cap-p` `jetpacs-device-can-p`
`jetpacs-capability-invoke` — plus the customization vars `jetpacs-host`
`jetpacs-port` `jetpacs-auth-token` `jetpacs-wants`.

Build-feature probe (since 1.7.0): `jetpacs-build-features` (the flat
symbol list of optional compile-time features this Emacs binary has —
positive knowledge, since a version floor is not a build guarantee) and
`jetpacs-feature-p`. A reporting surface only: nothing in the core gates
on it, and consumers keep feature-local guards (e.g.
`(sqlite-available-p)`) at the point of consumption.

### Command visibility (`jetpacs-commands.el`, since 1.25.0)

`jetpacs-command-visible-p` (should this command be offered on the
device? — the device M-x picker's `completing-read` predicate),
`jetpacs-suppressed-commands` (the customization var: symbols and
name regexps to hide), and the `'jetpacs-unsupported` symbol property
(the definition-site channel — `(put 'my-cmd 'jetpacs-unsupported t)`
marks a command not-for-mobile without touching the user's list).
UX-level suggestion filtering only, applied server-side before
candidates ship; the dispatch boundary remains the SPEC §5 allowlist,
and the Eval tab remains the escape hatch.

### Actions & state (`jetpacs-surfaces.el`)

`jetpacs-defaction` `jetpacs-on-state-change` `jetpacs-on-state-change-clear`
`jetpacs-ui-state` `jetpacs-ui-state-put` `jetpacs-ui-state-clear`
`jetpacs-ui-state-list` `jetpacs-in-action-p` (since 1.4.0: coerce a
multi-select value to a list of strings; report whether code runs inside an
action handler) `jetpacs-surface-push` `jetpacs-surface-remove`.

### Multi-tenant ownership (`jetpacs-surfaces.el`, `jetpacs-apps.el`)

`with-jetpacs-owner` `jetpacs-app-unregister` — plus the customization var
`jetpacs-strict-namespaces`. Wrap a Tier 1's registrations in
`(with-jetpacs-owner "my-app" …)` so its actions/views/settings are
attributed to it; then a cross-owner name collision warns (or errors
under `jetpacs-strict-namespaces`), and `jetpacs-app-unregister` tears the app
down cleanly for live reload or uninstall. Since 1.2.0 ownership also
*scopes*: owned drawer items, top actions, and settings sections/links
render only while their app is current (see BUILDING-TIER1 §7), and app
view names are namespaced `"<appid>.<view>"`.

### The shell / app seams

App scaffold (`jetpacs-shell.el`): `jetpacs-shell-define-view`
`jetpacs-shell-tab-view` `jetpacs-shell-nav-view` `jetpacs-shell-push`
`jetpacs-shell-notify` `jetpacs-shell-add-drawer-item`
`jetpacs-shell-add-top-action` `jetpacs-shell-default-fab-function`
`jetpacs-shell-settings-body` (since 1.1.0: the stock "settings" view's
whole scrollable body — an app with controls of its own defines a
`"<appid>.settings"` view and splices `jetpacs-settings-sections` into its
own lazy column instead), `jetpacs-shell-resolve-view` (since 1.2.0: a
logical core view name through the per-app override resolver — the
stock Settings drawer entry targets `(jetpacs-shell-resolve-view
"settings")`), and the hooks `jetpacs-shell-view-switched-hook`
`jetpacs-shell-refresh-hook` `jetpacs-shell-after-push-hook`.  Tab access
(since 1.4.0): `jetpacs-shell-current-tab` reads the active tab and
`jetpacs-shell-set-current-tab` switches to a registered tab through
`jetpacs-shell-push`.  Route params (since 1.15.0):
`jetpacs-shell-navigate` (carry an alist to a target view, pushing so the
companion lands on it), `jetpacs-shell-route-params` /
`jetpacs-route-param` (read the active or a named view's params — the
former doubles as an :overlay predicate), and `jetpacs-shell-clear-route`
(the explicit back).  A view builder that declares a *second* argument
receives its route params, so a detail screen is a pure function of them
rather than of a module state var.

Async loading (`jetpacs-async.el`, since 1.20.0): `jetpacs-async` — call
it from inside a view builder with a KEY and a `(lambda (resolve reject)
…)` LOADER; it returns `(pending)` / `(ready . VALUE)` / `(error .
MESSAGE)`, starting the loader once per key and re-pushing on completion
so the builder stays a pure read of the cache. A key a build stops asking
for is swept after the next push (running any cleanup thunk the loader
returned); `jetpacs-async-clear-owner` drops an app's entries on teardown
(wired into `jetpacs-app-unregister`) and `jetpacs-async-reset` clears all
state.

Devtools (`jetpacs-devtools.el`, since 1.21.0): `jetpacs-devtools-report`
— the live instrumentation report (per-builder wall clock, serialized
bytes per surface push, push rate, and a push-storm warning when a
builder re-triggers every push); `jetpacs-devtools-last-spec` — the spec
a view's builder last produced, for "what did the phone actually
receive"; `jetpacs-devtools-reset`; and the `jetpacs-devtools-enabled`
switch. Observation only — it never sends a frame, and its numbers are
what the Tier-3 performance gates (build reuse, delta frames, renderer
skipping) are measured against.

App identity (`jetpacs-apps.el`): `jetpacs-defapp` `jetpacs-apps-remove`
`jetpacs-apps-current` `jetpacs-apps-current-p` `jetpacs-apps-set-default-fab`
(since 1.2.0: the current-app predicate for gating dynamic
registrations, and the per-app default FAB that replaces setting
`jetpacs-shell-default-fab-function` directly — the direct set still works
but leaks the FAB onto every coexisting app's views).

Buffer skins (`jetpacs-buffer.el`): `jetpacs-render-buffer-register`
(since 1.8.0: `jetpacs-buffer-call-shimmed` — run a buffer's own
follow/visit command with the display functions and the triggering input
event shimmed away, returning where point lands; the follow primitive
under the results and hypertext substrates, for any skin that navigates
by invoking the mode's own commands).

Hypertext documents (`jetpacs-hypertext.el`, since 1.8.0): eww, help, and
Info render as document cards out of the box; the rider seam
`jetpacs-hypertext-register-shr-mode` puts any other shr-rendered mode
(elfeed-show, nov, devdocs — the known three pre-wired via
`with-eval-after-load`) on the same renderer in one line. Plus the
command `jetpacs-hypertext-image-cache-clear` and the customization vars
`jetpacs-hypertext-image-cache-max` `jetpacs-hypertext-table-max-rows`.

Section buffers (`jetpacs-sections.el`, since 1.9.0): every buffer built
on the third-party `magit-section` library (magit, forge, kubernetes.el,
`taxy-magit-section` consumers) renders as collapsible cards with no
registration needed — the base mode covers derivatives, and the library
is never required from the core. Row taps follow into the region view;
long-press serves the section's own key bindings as a bridged menu.
Public surface: the customization var `jetpacs-sections-max-lines`.

Remote hosts (`jetpacs-hosts.el`, since 1.10.0): the "hosts" view — a card
per TRAMP endpoint with Files (dired), Shell, Services (`daemons.el`,
soft), and Disconnect; ssh password prompts bridge to the phone, and
everything the host opens rides the existing substrates. Public surface:
the customization vars `jetpacs-hosts` (explicit LABEL → TRAMP-DIR
entries, the action allowlist) `jetpacs-hosts-from-ssh-config`
`jetpacs-hosts-connect-timeout`.

Tablist skins (`jetpacs-tablist.el`): the `jetpacs-tablist-header-functions`
`jetpacs-tablist-row-functions` `jetpacs-tablist-filter-functions` alists.

Files/editor (`jetpacs-files.el`): `jetpacs-files-editor-body-functions`
`jetpacs-files-editor-actions-functions` `jetpacs-files-editor-toolbar-function`
`jetpacs-files-open-hook` `jetpacs-files-after-save-hook` (since 1.4.0:
`jetpacs-files-open` opens a readable in-root path in the editor, and
`jetpacs-files-current-file` reads the currently open path).

Settings (`jetpacs-settings.el`): `jetpacs-settings-register-section`
`jetpacs-settings-remove-section` `jetpacs-settings-after-set-hook`
`jetpacs-settings-add-link` `jetpacs-settings-add-native-link`
`jetpacs-settings-sections` (since 1.1.0:
the flat node list an app splices into its own body when it replaces
the stock "settings" view; since 1.7.0 a section entry may carry
`:render`, a nullary node builder for a read-only informational row —
excluded from the wire-set gate and state handlers), plus
`jetpacs-native-settings-action` from `jetpacs-widgets.el`. Native links render first and must remain
useful offline; regular links render under Emacs Settings. Registered
sections and links render on the foundation's stock "settings" view
without further wiring.

### Validation (`jetpacs-lint.el`)

`jetpacs-lint-spec` `jetpacs-render-to-json` (see Phase B).
`jetpacs-lint-view-spec` (since 1.5.0: validate a declarative view `:spec`),
plus the vocabulary defconsts `jetpacs-lint-spec-layouts`
`jetpacs-lint-spec-transforms` `jetpacs-lint-spec-keys`
`jetpacs-lint-spec-chrome-kinds`.

Since 1.11.0 (the Spec 1.0-rc schema registry): `jetpacs-lint-payload`
(validate a frame kind + payload alist) and the authored schema tables
`jetpacs-lint-node-schema` `jetpacs-lint-kind-schema`
`jetpacs-lint-node-common-keys`, published in `ebp/contract.json`
(contract_format 2) as `node_schema` / `kind_schema` / `spec_version`.

Since 1.18.0 (the conditions core): `jetpacs-lint-trigger` (validate one
wire-shaped `triggers.set` entry — `when` predicate shapes, the on_fire
exactly-one-of `cap`/`notify` rule, and the `${…}` placeholder grammar)
plus `jetpacs-lint-state-predicate-types` (the SPEC §11 state-predicate
vocabulary, mirroring the companion's `StateSampler.STATE_TYPES` —
lint-time advisory; the live authority is the welcome's
`device.state_types` report).
`jetpacs-lint-spec` additionally enforces the node schema: a missing
required key is an error; a key outside a node's schema is a
`warning: `-prefixed problem, not an error — companions must ignore
unknown keys (SPEC §9 forward compat), so an author may deliberately
target a newer companion.

Tier-1 test helpers (since 1.16.0): `jetpacs-test-visible-text` (the
on-screen strings in a spec, tree-ordered — assert your view shows or
omits text without a companion), `jetpacs-test-view-ok` (assert a view
is lint-error-free *and* serializable, signalling with the problems on
failure — one line in an ERT suite), and `jetpacs-lint-views` (from
`jetpacs-shell.el`: build and lint every registered view, returning the
ones with problems — the app-wide CI gate `(should-not (jetpacs-lint-views
t))`). Since 1.23.0, `jetpacs-test-reset-state` (from
`jetpacs-surfaces.el`): reset every piece of per-session state to
pristine — ui-state, state-change subscriptions, the form registry, the
last-action timestamp, and (when loaded) the shell's route params /
current tab / pending snackbar, the async cache and push timer, the
source memo cache, and the devtools recording (scope completed in
1.24.0) — the ERT fixture seam, so a Tier-1 suite never let-binds `--`
internals. These ship what every Tier 1 used to re-derive privately.

### Declarative binding layer (since 1.5.0 — see [BINDING.md](BINDING.md))

Sources (`jetpacs-source.el`): `jetpacs-defsource` `jetpacs-source-query`
`jetpacs-source-fields` `jetpacs-source-invalidate` `jetpacs-source-remove`
`jetpacs-source-p` `jetpacs-source-catalog` `jetpacs-source-field-types`.

Views (`jetpacs-shell.el`, `jetpacs-spec.el`): the `:spec` keyword on
`jetpacs-shell-define-view` (an alternative to `:builder`, exactly one
required); the compiler itself is internal.

Forms (`jetpacs-surfaces.el`): `jetpacs-form` `jetpacs-form-field-id`
`jetpacs-form-value` `jetpacs-form-seed` `jetpacs-form-reset`
`jetpacs-form-dispose`. Declarative form specs (since 1.14.0):
`jetpacs-field` (a typed field spec — `text`/`number`/`decimal`/`date`/
`enum`/`bool`, `:required`, `:validate`, `:options`), `jetpacs-form-render`
(the input nodes, seeded + inline errors), and `jetpacs-form-submit` (an
`event.action` handler that parses/validates and, only on success, hands the
handler a typed alist), plus the seam var `jetpacs-form-refresh-function`.

Action metadata (`jetpacs-surfaces.el`): `jetpacs-action-catalog`, and the
`&key args doc` on `jetpacs-defaction`.

Capability fallback (`jetpacs.el`): `jetpacs-node-or`.

### Org primitive layer (`jetpacs-org.el`; note path since 1.6.0)

The one org query/mutation grammar every org-reading consumer (Glasspane,
`jetpacs-crud.el`) stands on — never re-implement it app-side.

Query: `jetpacs-org-parse-query` (string → org-ql sexp) and the two
accessors of the single built-in interpreter — `jetpacs-org-entry-matches-p`
(the org entry at point) and `jetpacs-org-note-matches-p` (a `vulpea-note`
off the index; `regexp` searches title + properties there, not the body).
`jetpacs-org-note-query-terms` / `jetpacs-org-note-query-supported-p` say
which sexps the index path evaluates — route anything else to org-ql.
`jetpacs-org-query` runs a parsed sexp over the agenda files (org-ql when
installed, the built-in interpreter otherwise), cached.

Vulpea engine (optional — the core never requires vulpea; apps or the
composer's dependency bootstrap install it):
`jetpacs-org-vulpea-available-p` (the probe),
`jetpacs-org-vulpea-source-notes` (a `:dir`/`:file`/`:heading` scope →
its indexed notes), `jetpacs-org-vulpea-query` (scope + sexp).

Identity & mutation: `jetpacs-org-heading-ref` `jetpacs-org-resolve-ref`
`jetpacs-org-with-mutation` `jetpacs-org-set-property`
`jetpacs-org-toggle-todo` `jetpacs-org-set-planning`.

Extraction & caching: `jetpacs-org-entry-typed-value`
`jetpacs-org-with-cache` `jetpacs-org-cache-invalidate`.

## Anything not listed here

Internal, even without a `--`. If a Tier 1 needs it, promote it here
first (that is the review gate for widening the surface). The
byte-compile of `test/core-load-test.el` plus a stability test assert
that every symbol named above is bound.
