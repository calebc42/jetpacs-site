# Building your own companion

The companion is the durable server: it listens, renders what Emacs
sends, caches the last-known UI, and queues actions while Emacs is away.
The reference implementation is Android (Kotlin / Jetpack Compose), but
nothing in the contract is Android's — a desktop tray app, an e-ink
dashboard, a terminal TUI, a web view on a tablet: anything that can hold
a TCP socket and draw boxes can be a companion.

[SPEC.md](../spec/) is the whole contract. This guide is the *build
order* — the rungs in the order they pay off, what to test at each one,
and where the reference Kotlin (in the
[jetpacs repo](https://github.com/calebc42/jetpacs)) does the same job.
§12 of the spec defines minimal conformance; this document is that
section, unrolled.

Two facts that make this easier than it looks:

- **You don't need a phone or Emacs-on-Android.** The transport is plain
  NDJSON over loopback TCP. Desktop Emacs 28+ speaks the client side
  out of the box: point `jetpacs-host` / `jetpacs-port` at your companion,
  set the token, `M-x jetpacs-connect`. Your whole development loop can
  run on one machine.
- **The conformance fixtures already exist.**
  [`goldens/widgets.golden`](https://github.com/calebc42/ebp/blob/slop-fork/main/goldens/widgets.golden) is one JSON line per
  node the client can emit — every wire shape, machine-checked against
  the elisp constructors on every CI run. Feed each line to your
  renderer in your own test suite and you are held to the same truth the
  reference companion is. [`goldens/frames.golden`](https://github.com/calebc42/ebp/blob/slop-fork/main/goldens/frames.golden)
  does the same for trigger/capability frames (§10–§11), and
  [`validate.py`](https://github.com/calebc42/ebp/blob/slop-fork/main/validate.py) is a runnable reference for the schema
  checks.

## The rungs

### Rung 0 — socket and envelope (SPEC §1–§2)

Listen on `127.0.0.1:8765`. One JSON object per `\n`-terminated line;
tolerate partial lines across reads and ignore blank lines. Parse the
five envelope fields; answer `ping` with `pong` (`reply_to` = the ping's
`id`). Log-and-continue on any unknown `kind` — an unknown frame must
never kill the connection.

*Reference:* `FrameCodec.kt`, `Envelope.kt`, `JetpacsServer.kt`.
*Test:* `M-x jetpacs-ping` from desktop Emacs round-trips.

### Rung 1 — handshake and pairing auth (SPEC §3)

The four-frame dance: `session.hello` → `auth.challenge` →
`auth.response` → `session.welcome`. Generate a pairing token, show it
once in your UI, never send it. Verify the client's
`HMAC-SHA256(token, "ebp1:client:" + SNONCE + ":" + CNONCE)` and
prove yourself back with the `server` variant (nonces swapped). Fail
closed on a bad mac — refuse before trusting anything.

Your welcome must carry: `granted` (the intersection of the client's
`wants` with what you actually support — never grant what you can't
host), **`node_types`** (the flat list of §9 node `t`s you render — the
negotiation that lets a newer client fall back gracefully on you),
`surfaces` (your cached surface → revision map, empty at first), and
`queued_events`.

*Reference:* `JetpacsAuth.kt`, the welcome builder in `JetpacsConnection.kt`.
*Test:* desktop Emacs logs "handshake ok"; a wrong token is refused.

### Rung 2 — surfaces, revisions, cache (SPEC §4)

Store the latest spec per surface id; **reject any revision that is not
strictly newer** than what you hold (this is what makes pushes
idempotent and replay-safe); render `app:*` surfaces; keep rendering
the cache while Emacs is disconnected — offline display *is* the
feature. Multi-view specs (`{views, initial_view}`) switch locally via
the `view.switch` builtin, answered with a drop-policy `view.switched`
event; never yank the user's view on a background update.

*Reference:* `SurfaceStore.kt`, `SurfaceManager.kt`.

### Rung 3 — the renderer (SPEC §9, §12)

Walk the node tree; render the families you support. The two iron
rules: **unknown keys are ignored**, and **an unknown node type renders
its `children` if it has any, else nothing — never a crash**. Only
advertise in `node_types` what you actually draw. Value-carrying
callbacks (`on_change`, `on_submit`, `on_save`, `on_pick`) dispatch
their action with the widget's current value injected into `args` as
`value`.

Start tiny: `text`, `column`, `card`, `button` render a legible
dashboard. `jetpacs-hello.el` (jetpacs repo, ~60 lines) is your first
integration test — load it from the connected Emacs and you should see
a card, a counter, and a button whose tap round-trips (rung 4).

*Reference:* `SduiRenderer.kt`, `SduiContentNodes.kt`,
`SduiInputNodes.kt`, `SduiScaffold.kt`.
*Test:* every `widgets.golden` line parses and renders (or degrades)
without crashing.

### Rung 4 — actions and the offline queue (SPEC §5–§6)

Taps become `event.action {action, args}` frames. Honor the spec
author's `when_offline` policy: `queue` (persist, replay in order),
`drop`, `wake` (best-effort start Emacs, then queue). A queued action
replaces any queued action with the same `dedupe` key. Mirror widget
state into `state.changed`. After a reconnect, answer `queue.replay` by
streaming the queued events in order and finishing with
`queue.drained {delivered, expired}`.

You are now a **minimal conforming companion** per SPEC §12.

*Reference:* `ActionReceiver.kt`, `JetpacsDatabase.kt` (the queue).

### Optional rungs — each behind its grant

- **§7 dialogs / toasts / reminders** (`surfaces.dialog`, …) — dialogs
  unlock the minibuffer bridge: Emacs prompts become your native
  dialogs. *Reference:* `JetpacsDialogState.kt`, `Reminders.kt`.
- **§8 editor sync** — a live text editor backed by Emacs: deltas in
  code points, completion, diagnostics, eldoc. The invariant to keep:
  wrong state may cost a feature, never a wrong edit. *Reference:*
  `EditorSync.kt`.
- **§10 device capabilities** — effectors Emacs can invoke, with typed
  errors (`cap-unsupported` / `cap-permission` / `cap-failed`).
  *Reference:* `DeviceCapabilities.kt`.
- **§11 device triggers** — replace-set registrations, host-side
  hysteresis/throttling, and the deliberately closed `on_fire`
  vocabulary (no conditionals, no loops — logic lives in Emacs).
  *Reference:* `TriggerHost.kt`, `BootReceiver.kt`.

Don't grant a capability you can't host; the client degrades cleanly
around an absent grant, and that degradation is a *designed* path, not
an error path.

## The non-negotiables

1. **Forward compatibility** — unknown kinds, keys, node types, draw
   ops, and `on_fire` entries are logged and skipped, never fatal.
2. **Fail-closed auth** — no state is trusted before the mac verifies;
   your `server_proof` is not optional.
3. **Revision monotonicity** — a stale or replayed `surface.update`
   must be a no-op.
4. **Nothing on the wire is code** — you render data and report events
   by name. The companion never evaluates, shells out for, or
   dispatches anything the wire names (the closed `on_fire` vocabulary
   is the one, deliberately tiny exception).

## Conformance checklist, borrowed

The jetpacs repo's
[ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/calebc42/jetpacs/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#kotlin-conformance-checklist-the-contract-tripwire)
maintains the table mapping every reference-companion surface to its
SPEC section. Reuse it as your own audit: for each row, either your
companion implements the section or it doesn't grant/advertise it.
There is no third state.

## License

The spec is an interface anyone may implement. A clean-room companion
written against SPEC.md carries no obligation from this repo's GPLv3 —
see the README's License section. (If you *port* the reference Kotlin,
that's a derivative work and GPLv3 applies.)
